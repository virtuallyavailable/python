## Python list 
List is changeabgle which means that we can delete or add data in it. We can add matched data in it.List items are also indexed.List is always shown with Square brackets.
## List items - Data types
List items consist of any data types. These are int string boolean and float data types.List also contains different data types in one variable.
## List constructor
When we use double round brackets for creating new list this is known as list constructor.
## Access items
We can access to the list items by using indexing. List items are indexed. 
## Range of indexes
we can know about the range of indexes by specifying from where the range start or end.
## Change Item Value
We can also change any item in a given list by using index number.
## Insert items
We can insert different items in a list without replacing any value.
## Append items
Add any item at the end of a list this method is known as append items.
## Extend items
Adding of items from another list to current list is called extend lists.
## Add any iterable
All sequence types are iterable. We can also add any iterable in a list. Iterable objects are lists, set, dictinoaries and tuple
## Remove Specified Item
If we want to remove any item we will use the method of remove Specified item. It removes the Specified item from the list.
## Remove Specified Index
To delete any Specified index from the list we can use pop method. 
## Del keyword 
del keyword is also used to delete any specific index. Complete list is delete by this keyword.
## Clear list
The clear list method makes the set empty. The list is still remained but there is no content included in it
## List comprehension
It is an easy way to define and create lists based on existing lists.
## Sort lists
Sort list method is used to sort the list in descending and ascending method.All the elements in the list are sort
## Case Insensitive Sort
In this method by default capital letters are written first and then lower letters are written.
## Reverse Order
If we want to reverse any element in the list we use reserve order method. It reserves the current sorting order of elements.
## Copy a list
Copy list method copies the whole list and returns its copied list. It does not affect the original copy.
## Join a list
merging of two or more lists is called concatenate. The most easiest way is using + operator.
## Tuples in Python
Tuples are used to store multiple data. They allow duplicate members in a list. Tuples are unchangeable. Always show with braces.
## Access Tuple items
By using index number we can access towards the tuple items.
## Change Tuple Values
When we created tuple first time they cannot change again, but we can convert the tuple into list change the list and again convert list in the form of tuple.
## Packed or unpacked tuples
During creating tuples we assign values to it. This is called packing tuple
When we assign multiple variables to a tuple. This is called unpacking tuples
## Multiply tuples
If we want many items in a list we multiply the given items with a number.
